</div>

<p>You didn't write that awful page. You're just trying to get some
data out of it. Beautiful Soup is here to help. Since 2004, it's been
saving programmers hours or days of work on quick-turnaround
screen scraping projects.</p>

<p>Beautiful Soup is a Python library designed for quick turnaround
projects like screen-scraping. Three features make it powerful:

<ol>

<li>Beautiful Soup provides a few simple methods and Pythonic idioms
for navigating, searching, and modifying a parse tree: a toolkit for
dissecting a document and extracting what you need. It doesn't take
much code to write an application

<li>Beautiful Soup automatically converts incoming documents to
Unicode and outgoing documents to UTF-8. You don't have to think
about encodings, unless the document doesn't specify an encoding and
Beautiful Soup can't detect one. Then you just have to specify the
original encoding.

<li>Beautiful Soup sits on top of popular Python parsers like <a
href="http://lxml.de/">lxml</a> and <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/">html5lib</a>, allowing you
to try out different parsing strategies or trade speed for
flexibility.

</ol>

<p>Beautiful Soup parses anything you give it, and does the tree
traversal stuff for you. You can tell it "Find all the links", or
"Find all the links of class <tt>externalLink</tt>", or "Find all the
links whose urls match "foo.com", or "Find the table heading that's
got bold text, then give me that text."

<p>Valuable data that was once locked up in poorly-designed websites
is now within your reach. Projects that would have taken hours take
only minutes with Beautiful Soup.

<a name="Download"><h2>Download Beautiful Soup</h2></a>

<p>The current release is <a href="bs4/download/">Beautiful Soup
4.12.2</a> (April 7, 2023). You can install Beautiful Soup 4 with
<code>pip install beautifulsoup4</code>.

<p>In Debian and Ubuntu, Beautiful Soup is available as the
<code>python3-bs4</code> package. In Fedora it's
available as the <code>python3-beautifulsoup4</code> package.

<p>Beautiful Soup is licensed under the MIT license, so you can also
download the tarball, drop the <code>bs4/</code> directory into almost
any Python application (or into your library path) and start using it
immediately.

<p>Beautiful Soup 4 is supported on Python versions 3.6 and
greater. Support for Python 2 was discontinued on January 1, 2021&mdash;one
year after the Python 2 sunsetting date.

<h3>Beautiful Soup 3</h3>

<p>Beautiful Soup 3 was the official release line of Beautiful Soup
from May 2006 to March 2012. It does not support Python 3 and was
discontinued or January 1, 2021&mdash;one year after the Python 2
sunsetting date. If you have any active projects using Beautiful Soup
3, you should migrate to Beautiful Soup 4 as part of your Python 3
conversion.

<p><a
href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs3/documentation.html">Here's
the Beautiful Soup 3 documentation.</a>

<p>The current and hopefully final release of Beautiful Soup 3 is <a
href="download/3.x/BeautifulSoup-3.2.2.tar.gz">3.2.2</a> (October 5,
2019). It's the <code>BeautifulSoup</code> package on pip. It's also
available as <code>python-beautifulsoup</code> in Debian and Ubuntu,
and as <code>python-BeautifulSoup</code> in Fedora.

<p>Once Beautiful Soup 3 is discontinued, these package names will be available for use by a more recent version of Beautiful Soup.

<p>Beautiful Soup 3, like Beautiful Soup 4, is <a href="https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-beautifulsoup?utm_source=pypi-beautifulsoup&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=website">supported through Tidelift</a>.</p>

<a name="HallOfFame"><h2>Hall of Fame</h2></a>

<p>Over the years, Beautiful Soup has been used in hundreds of
different projects. There's no way I can list them all, but I want to
highlight a few high-profile projects. Beautiful Soup isn't what makes
these projects interesting, but it did make their completion easier:

<ul>

<li><a
 href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/25/arts/design/25vide.html">"Movable
 Type"</a>, a work of digital art on display in the lobby of the New
 York Times building, uses Beautiful Soup to scrape news feeds.

<li>Jiabao Lin's <a
href="https://github.com/BlankerL/DXY-COVID-19-Crawler">DXY-COVID-19-Crawler</a>
uses Beautiful Soup to scrape a Chinese medical site for information
about COVID-19, making it easier for researchers to track the spread
of the virus. (Source: <a href="https://blog.tidelift.com/how-open-source-software-is-fighting-covid-19">"How open source software is fighting COVID-19"</a>)

<li>Reddit uses Beautiful Soup to <a
href="https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/85f9cff3e2ab9bb8f19b96acd8da4ebacc079f04/r2/r2/lib/media.py">parse
a page that's been linked to and find a representative image</a>.

<li>Alexander Harrowell uses Beautiful Soup to <a
 href="http://www.harrowell.org.uk/viktormap.html">track the business
 activities</a> of an arms merchant.

<li>The developers of Python itself used Beautiful Soup to <a
href="http://svn.python.org/view/tracker/importer/">migrate the Python
bug tracker from Sourceforge to Roundup</a>.

<li>The <a href="http://www2.ljworld.com/">Lawrence Journal-World</a>
uses Beautiful Soup to <A
href="http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2010/nov/02/news-done-broke/">gather
statewide election results</a>.

<li>The <a href="http://esrl.noaa.gov/gsd/fab/">NOAA's Forecast
Applications Branch</a> uses Beautiful Soup in <a
href="http://laps.noaa.gov/topograbber/">TopoGrabber</a>, a script for
downloading "high resolution USGS datasets."

</ul>
